# ElectricLink

It's like a Turbolink, but a little less wasteful. It currently only supports
links, but to be honest, that's the part I use PJAX/Turbolinks for anyway.

This is a demo, but I could imagine publishing this as a library. I've added a
search field, so you can enter something to see that this doesn't change when
you click a link. There is also a link to a file that doesn't exist so you can
see the error handling.

## Trying it out

Run:

```
npm i
npm run watch
```

and visit http://localhost:8080

For the lazy ones, you can also visit: http://electric.dohmen.io
